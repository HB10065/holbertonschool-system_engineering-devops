Explanations of Additional Elements:
Why add 1 additional server?
To separate components onto dedicated servers, allowing each to be optimized and scaled independently based on specific resource requirements and traffic patterns.

Why add 1 additional load balancer (configured as cluster)?
To eliminate the load balancer as a single point of failure. The clustered load balancers work together with failover capability - if one fails, the other takes over seamlessly.

Why split components (web server, application server, database) onto separate servers?
Separate Web Servers:

Web servers primarily handle HTTP requests and serve static content
Can be scaled horizontally based on traffic volume
Require less CPU but more network bandwidth
Easier to add more web servers during traffic spikes
Separate Application Servers:

Application servers run business logic and process dynamic requests
Require more CPU and memory for code execution
Can be scaled independently from web traffic
Isolates application crashes from affecting web server availability
Separate Database Server:

Databases require different resources (high I/O, memory for caching)
Can be optimized specifically for database performance (SSD storage, memory allocation)
Security isolation - database is not directly exposed to web traffic
Easier to implement specialized database backup and replication strategies
Can upgrade database hardware without affecting web/application layers
