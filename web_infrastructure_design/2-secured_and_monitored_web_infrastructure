-Explanations of Additional Elements:
    Why add 3 Firewalls?
    To control and filter incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules,
    protecting each layer of the infrastructure from unauthorized access and malicious attacks.

    Why add SSL Certificate?
    To enable HTTPS and encrypt all data transmitted between users and the server,
    protecting sensitive information from being intercepted.

    Why add 3 Monitoring Clients?
    To collect metrics, logs, and performance data from each component of the infrastructure
    for analysis, alerting, and troubleshooting.


-What are firewalls for?
Firewalls act as a security barrier that filters network traffic based on predefined rules.
They block unauthorized access, prevent malicious attacks, and allow only legitimate traffic
to reach the servers.


-Why is traffic served over HTTPS?
HTTPS encrypts data in transit using SSL/TLS, ensuring:

    Confidentiality: Data cannot be read by third parties
    Integrity: Data cannot be modified during transmission
    Authentication: Users can verify they're connecting to the legitimate website


-What is monitoring used for?
Monitoring is used to:

    Track server health and performance metrics (CPU, memory, disk usage)
    Detect and alert on failures or anomalies
    Analyze traffic patterns and user behavior
    Troubleshoot issues quickly
    Plan capacity and resource allocation


-How does the monitoring tool collect data?
The monitoring clients (data collectors) installed on each server:

    Gather metrics from system resources and application logs
    Send this data to a centralized monitoring service (like Sumologic)
    The service aggregates, analyzes, and visualizes the data
    Generates alerts when thresholds are exceeded


-How to monitor web server QPS (Queries Per Second)?
Configure the monitoring client to:

    Track Nginx access logs
    Count the number of HTTP requests received per second
    Set up a metric/dashboard in the monitoring tool to display QPS
    Configure alerts if QPS exceeds normal thresholds


-Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue:
Traffic between the load balancer and backend servers is unencrypted (HTTP).
If someone gains access to the internal network, they can intercept sensitive data in plain text


-Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue:
The Primary database is a single point of failure for write operations. If it fails,
the application cannot perform any data modifications (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), making parts of
the website non-functional.


-Why having servers with all the same components might be a problem:
    Resource inefficiency: Not all components need the same resources. Web servers need different
    resources than databases.
    Security risk: If one component is compromised, all components on that server are at risk.
    Scalability limitation: Cannot scale individual components independently based on demand.
    Maintenance complexity: Updating one component requires affecting all components on the server.
