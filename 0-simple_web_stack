-What is a server?
A server is a physical or virtual computer that provides resources, data, services,
or programs to other computers (clients) over a network.


-What is the role of the domain name?
The domain name (foobar.com) is a human-readable address that allows users to access
the website without memorizing the IP address. It acts as a user-friendly
alias for the server's IP address.


-What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com?----------------
www is a CNAME record (Canonical Name) or an A record pointing to the server IP 8.8.8.8.
In this case, it's configured as a subdomain that resolves to the server's IP address.


-What is the role of the web server?
The web server (Nginx) handles HTTP/HTTPS requests from users' browsers. It:

    Receives incoming requests
    Serves static content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images)
    Forwards dynamic requests to the application server
    Returns responses to the client


-What is the role of the application server?
The application server executes the business logic of your application. It:

    Processes dynamic content
    Runs your code base (e.g., Python, PHP, Node.js)
    Communicates with the database
    Generates dynamic responses based on user requests


-What is the role of the database?
The database (MySQL) stores and manages persistent data such as:

    User information
    Content (posts, products, etc.)
    Application configurations
    It allows data to be created, read, updated, and deleted (CRUD operations)


-What is the server using to communicate with the user's computer?
The server uses HTTP/HTTPS protocol over TCP/IP to communicate with the user's 
computer through the internet.


-SPOF (Single Point of Failure)
Everything runs on one server. Meaning if the server crashes, goes offline,
or has hardware failure, the entire website becomes unavailable.


-Downtime when maintenance is needed
Deploying new code requires restarting the web server or application server,
causing the website to be temporarily unavailable.
So the users cannot access the site during updates, leading to poor user experience
and potential lost revenue.


-Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic
A single server has limited CPU, RAM, and bandwidth. When traffic exceeds these limits,
the server becomes slow or unresponsive therefore unable to keep up with a large amount of users.
