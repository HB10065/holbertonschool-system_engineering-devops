-Explanations of Additional Elements:
    Why add a Load Balancer (HAproxy)?
    To distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers, preventing any single server
    from being overwhelmed and improving availability and performance.

    Why add 2 servers instead of 1?
    To eliminate single point of failure and provide redundancy. If one server fails, the
    other can continue serving requests.

    Why add a database Primary-Replica cluster?
    To improve read performance, provide data redundancy, and enable failover capability if
    the primary database fails.


-What distribution algorithm is configured?
Round Robin - The load balancer distributes requests sequentially to each server in turn.

Request 1 → Server 1
Request 2 → Server 2
Request 3 → Server 1
Request 4 → Server 2 (and so on...)


-Active-Active or Active-Passive setup?
This is an Active-Active setup.

    Active-Active: Both servers actively handle traffic simultaneously.
    The load balancer distributes requests between both servers.

    Active-Passive: Only one server actively handles traffic while the other remains on standby (passive).
    The passive server only activates if the active one fails.


-Database Primary-Replica Cluster:
How it works:
The Primary (Master) node handles all write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
Changes made to the Primary are automatically replicated to the Replica (Slave) node
The Replica node can handle read operations (SELECT queries)
Data synchronization flows one way: Primary → Replica


-Difference between Primary and Replica nodes:
Primary node: Handles write operations and read operations. The application sends all
data modifications here.
Replica node: Handles only read operations. The application can query it for data retrieval to
reduce load on the Primary, but cannot write to it directly.


-SPOF (Single Points of Failure):
Load Balancer: If HAproxy fails, the entire website goes down
Primary Database: If the Primary database fails, no write operations can be performed
Single network connection: If the network fails, all servers become unreachable


-Security Issues:
No firewall: Servers are exposed to any type of traffic and potential attacks
No HTTPS: Data transmitted between users and servers is unencrypted, allowing interception of
sensitive information (passwords, personal data)


-No Monitoring:
Cannot detect when servers are down or experiencing issues
No visibility into performance metrics (CPU, memory, response times)
Cannot receive alerts when problems occur
Difficult to identify bottlenecks or plan for capacity
